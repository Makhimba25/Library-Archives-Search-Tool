# Book-Search-Program


* This tool was developed to help organize a library of over 200 books.

* The original data set features the Title, Author, Description, Setting, Location and Read status of each book.

* The first part of the program allows users to search for a book by the title. Once typed in, the program returns the location of the book on my bookshelf and other information about the book. Time Saved: 10 minutes

* The second part of the program helps users figure out which book they should recommend to users of the library by asking questions to narrow down the search based on their preferences at the time. Time Saved: 60 minutes

* As an added bonus, the program also tells the user how books are distributed across genre and which books there are  multiple copies of to avoid double purchasing or lending. Money Saved: infinity
